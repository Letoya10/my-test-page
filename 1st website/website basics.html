    <p>HTML (<b><u>H</u></b>yper<b><u>T</u></b>ext <b><u>M</u></b>arkup <b><u>L</u></b>anguage) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.</p>
    <p style="font-size: small;"><I>PS:it was invented by Physicst Tim Benres-Lee, the first version was published in 1993.</I></p>
    <h2 style="color: limegreen;">So what is HTML?</h2>
    <p>HTML is a <b>markup language</b> that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. For example, if we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:</p>
    <h3 style="color: red;">Anatomy of an HTML element</h3>
    <img src="grumpy-cat-small.png" alt="My test image" width = 350px, height = 250px>
    <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>The opening tag:</b>This consists of the name of the element (eg, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect.</li>
      <li><b>The closing tag:</b>This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends â€” in this case where the paragraph ends.</li>
      <li>other</li>
    </ol>

    <h4 style="color: limegreen;">Summary</h4>
    <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure and content of a webpage, it says what content should be on a webpage. An HTML document is made up of a series of elements. Some elements we covered in this lesson are...</p>
